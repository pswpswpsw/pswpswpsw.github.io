  <!-- <div class="title">
    <a class="title_link" id="" href="#">A Letter to Candidates</a>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
      <p class="title">Dear Prospective Students,</p>
      <p>Thanks for your interest in being a part of our group! I have multiple fully-funded Ph.D., MPhil, postdoc, research assistant, and intern positions available at the AI Thrust, HKUST (Guangzhou).</p>

      <p class="title">My Goal and Principles</p>

      <p>My goal is to conduct impactful research for the benefit of society (AI for social good). I aim to push our research frontiers towards autonomous machine intelligence. Therefore the primary motivation for publishing papers should be to make a significant impact on the research community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I highly value open-source, transparency and collaboration</span> as I believe they are the key factors for the success of our community. As researchers, we should also keep open-minded and be curious about areas outside of our field, so we could continue to grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also believe we are engineers first, and then we are AI research scientists.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">  "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."</p>

      <p class="title">My Operational Style</p>

      <p>I hope to build a focused and collaborative group. I think weekly group meetings are valuable to everyone to learn a bit about the research outside of their own area, as long as they are kept short and efficient. Then I would also schedule one-on-one meetings on a need basis. I try to keep normal working hours myself (so please don’t send me messages late at night) and tend to come to the office early. I don’t think long working hours are necessary. If you are focused and continuously work 40-50 hours a week for four years, you are bound to succeed on any research topic. Eventually, I hope my team members can be <span style="font-weight: bold;">happy and proud of their own work.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="title">Ongoing Projects</p>

      <p>Please refer to <a href="./projects.html">this page</a>.</p>

      <p class="title">Expectations for Ph.D. Students</p>

      <p>
        Congrats! Please consider this as a significant financial investment (~1M over four years) from the University and I in yourself.
        My primary goal is to help you grow into the experts in your own field.
        I believe a successful Ph.D. should have name recognition among fellow researchers by the time of thesis proposal (ideally with >400 citations).
        In addition, I expect my students to open-source all of their published work whenever it is permitted.
        I think in the first year, one top-tier publication is good enough. In the coming years, I would like to see growth and push for more continuous and impactful work.
        Keeping track of progress on all the research work is important as well.
        Take a read on Prof. Mingming Cheng's <a href="https://mmcheng.net/notice/">advice</a>.
        In terms of university-level graduation requirement, you only need to propose and defend your thesis successfully, which is the same as CMU.

      </p>

      <p class="title">I want to join HKUST (GZ). What graduate programs should I apply to?</p>

      <p>You could apply to the MPhil or Ph.D. program of the AI Thrust.</p>

      <p class="title">I am a HKUST (GZ) student. How do I join your group?</p>

      <p>Send me an email and/or drop by my office - I'd be happy to chat! </p>

      <p class="title">Are you accepting RA/interns/visitors?</p>
      <p>Yes!</p>

      <p class="title">Should I contact you before applying to HKUST (GZ) for admission?</p>
      <p>Admissions across all Ph.D./MPhil programs are done by department-level committees but my endorsement would be a decisive vote for your acceptance. So you could send me the documents listed below if you are interested in my research directions.</p>

      <p class="title">Application Documents</p>
      <p>I will carefully consider all applications. Due to the large volume of applications, only shortlisted applicants will be contacted within a month.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CV.</li>
        <li>Transcripts.</li>
        <li>Selected publications (if any).</li>
        <li>Selected projects / Github (if any).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="title">Advice on Research</p>

      <p>
        Be the first. Be the simplest one. Then be the flashy one.
      </p>

      <p class="title">More about me (and other random thoughts)</p>
      <p>
        I spent six wonderful years with my Ph.D. advisor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Py54GcEAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Alex Hauptmann</a>. Alex is one of the most important people in my life and I have learned a great deal from him, both as a good researcher and as a good person.
        The only complaint I would have with him would be that he did not push me enough during my Ph.D. studies. <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/24295398/answer/2584752461">Take a look at how chilled I was</a>.
        Therefore I would try to strike a balance between his style and a stricter one. I hope my students can achieve their own level of work-life-balance since different people might have different ratios on how they want to spend their time.
        The principle, as mentioned before, is that I want my students and I, to be happy first, and then also be proud of their own work. The assumption, of course, is that you and I want to achieve the same goal, which is making an impact in the research community (not just wanting to graduate).
        I liked Andrej Karpathy's <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/Ph.D./">A Survival Guide to a Ph.D.</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my Ph.D. graduation, I received all the big packages from big companies you can think of (Huawei, Tencent, Momenta, Alibaba, Google), and with the top 1% - 10% TC among Ph.D.s.
        However, I found that I wasn’t making the impact that I was hoping for.
        And most of the time, it is impossible to dive deep into a research direction without the pressure of making a profit for the company in the short term.
        <!-- And, I was put on a spreadsheet sent to the whole business group where I was ranked first on GPU-hour consumption. f*** 10*
        Besides, having peer pressure to drink at dinners with colleagues (not to mention with managers/clients) is <span style="font-weight: bold;">an extremely toxic culture</span> IMO.
        This seems common in larger Chinese firms and (rarely) in some labs in Chinese universities, based on my observation.
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">I would avoid and forbid this kind of toxic culture (at least in my lab) as this is bad for one's health and super weird.</span>-->
        <!-- Well I guess drinking some MaoTai every now and then is good for one's health. LOL. -->
        <!-- Also, I want my students to have a clear sense of credit for their work, especially when collaborating with each other.
        It is beneficial to communicate early about who is the first author/equal contribution, etc.
      </p>
